Language science and psychological science have an uneasy relationship with statistics, both as a tool for dealing with data and a tool for building theories.
In this talk, I will discuss the historical disappointments and resulting prejudices against statistics as well as critical insights made possible by statistics, before discussing the current state of the field.
In particular, I will discuss what modern, computer-age statistical practice -- such as mixed-effects models, Bayesian statistics and machine learning -- has to offer compared to traditional tools and why it's time to use tools that Clark and Cohen could have only dreamed of.
I will focus on modern statistical approaches as a tool for theory building -- both for theories with stochastic and variable components and as a tool for handling messy and variable real-world data -- instead of as an alternative to theory building.
Finally, I will conclude with my vision for (the role of) statistics in the future of psychology and linguistics and provide a few suggestions for how to achieve that vision.
